# Wnk Unity Code Test

Thanks for taking the Wnk code test! The goal of this test is to ascertain your level of experience with Unity, C#, CS principles, and collaboration/team code practices. Don't worry about supplying an imperfect or incomplete solution, so long as you can demonstrate your thought processes and way of working. If you have any additional questions about the test, please direct them to: brian.schulman@wnkinc.co

# The Prompt

Build a small, top-down, 2D Superhot clone. In Superhot, time only moves when you move. You can shoot, and your enemies can shoot, but they can only shoot if they see you. The main features are:

* Simple 2D level and characters (programmer art or basic shapes a-okay!)
* Time only moves while you are moving
* Enemies in the level will begin attacking if they can see you (need to be looking in your direction)
* Enemies only move when time is flowing
* Enemy and player bullets only move when time is flowing
* You win when all enemies are defeated
* You lose when enemies hit you

Bonus points:

* UI showing lists of live and dead enemies
* Enemy patrol/motion patterns
* Reset button
* Time rewind button
